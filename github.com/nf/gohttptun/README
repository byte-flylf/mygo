gohttptunnel

A tool to tunnel TCP over HTTP 
by Andrew Gerrand <adg@golang.org>

Example usage:

Run 'server' at your endpoint, by default it listens on port 8888.
	./server

Run 'client' on your local machine, by default it listens locally on 2222.
Use -http=serverAddress:8888 to point to your server, 
and -dest=destAddr:destPort to point to your tunnel endpoint
(default is -dest=127.0.0.1:22 to connect to local sshd on the server).
	./client -http=serverAddress:8888

With both of them running (you must start server first), you can then
connect via ssh to localhost:2222 on the local machine:
	ssh -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1

You should then be tunnelling SSH over HTTP. Pretty neat, huh?
